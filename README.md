# Web Map Design
This website is an exercise in thematic map and web page design. The first map represents the locations and density of cell towers within Washington state while the second maps the airports with and without air traffic control towers in the United States. Using Leaflet and JavaScript plugins, these maps were designed to be interactive with popups being bound to the point features and colored using functions.
